## Perceptron
Perceptron is somewhat similar to sigmoid function but different.   
It is hard version of sigmoid function.

> Perceptron is not something that's widely used in practice.   
> We study it mostly for historical reasons.   
> It is not used because it does not have a probabilistic interpretation of what 's happening.      
> Also it could never classify xor
